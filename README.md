# UnknotThePlot

Computer Graphics project using C++, OpenGL & SDL library.

A word guessing game where the player tries to guess the movie name by picking the letters from an alphabet board. The playerâ€™s main target is to rescue Pete from sinking. 

If the player guessed a letter which occurs in the movie name, the floating ball where Pete stands on will come nearer to the shore. If the guessed letter does not occur in the movie name, the floating ball will slightly sink. If the player succeeded in guessing the whole movie name, Pete will be rescued else he will sink.
